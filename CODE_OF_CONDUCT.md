# Code of conduct

## The BDFL

BDFL stands for benevolent dictator for life.\
This project's BDFL is [replicadse](https://github.com/replicadse). His word counts, no matter the circumstances.

## Guidelines

While most codes of conduct make it arbitrarily hard being honest because nomeone might feel offended by other people's opinion. This is not the case in this project. I do expect a minimum of common sense from everyone who wants to contribute. As a rule of thumb: Just don't be an asshole.\
Everyone can and should voice his or her opinion freely without having to be scared that this might hurt someones feelings and he or she get's excluded from the project. We always value honest and constructive feedback on a professional level. If you can't handle open and honest discussions in which people might voice drastically different opinions, you're free to leave. The one and only thing we care about is your contribution to this project and nothing else.\
Feel free to voice constructive feedback, have heated conversations about various topics and disagree with anything but ultimately, this is not a democracy.

## Compliance

Not complying with this code might result in a permanent ban from this project. Ultimate decision lies at the BDFL.
