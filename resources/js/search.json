For every request, a routing service is invoked which returns the destination for that message including other metadata (like headers).","Authorization service It brings built in authorization that is performed before a persistent connection is established.","OnConnect/OnDisconnect services These are invoked when a client has connected / disconnected respectively.","Monitoring Structured log messages for events and, if configured, interval reporting about the application's state are available.","Easy installs via HELM charts","Multi language / framework support By deciding against a DSL or other language/framework lock-ins for routing etc., you can implement authorization, connect, message routing, message handling and disconnect in your own favorite language.
